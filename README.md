Industrial Control Systems Network Protocol Parsers  (ICSNPP) 

Industrial Control Systems protocol parsers plugins for the Zeek network security monitoring framework. Currently we have four fully developed protocol parsers but we plan on adding more in the future.

Full ICS Protocol Parsers:
* [BACnet](zeek_bacnet_parser):
    * Full Zeek protocol parser for BACnet
* [Ethernet/IP and CIP](zeek_enip_parser): 
    * Full Zeek protocol parser for Ethernet/IP and CIP
* [BSAP over IP](zeek_bsap_ip_parser)
    * Full Zeek protocol parser for BSAP (Bristol Standard Asynchronous Protocol) over IP
* [BSAP Serial->Ethernet](zeek_bsap_serial_parser)
    * Full Zeek protocol parser for BSAP (Bristol Standard Asynchronous Protocol) over Serial->Ethernet  

Updates to Zeek ICS Protocol Parsers:
* [DNP3](zeek_dnp3_parser)
    * Updates to DNP3 Zeek scripts for Zeek's default DNP3 protocol parser
* [Modbus](zeek_modbus_parser)
    * Updates to Modbus Zeek scripts for Zeek's default Modbus protocol parser
